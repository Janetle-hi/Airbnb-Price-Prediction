Group Members: Hailin Du, Qianwen Qian, Yan Wang, Trang Le, Zibo Xu, Songchen Nan

**Problem**

Airbnb is one of the largest online marketplaces for arranging or offering apartments, homestays and lodging. The number of bookings and listings are growing fast, there are over 6 million listings worldwide in 2019. New York is listed as one of the top 10 popular cities for booking experiences in the world.
The total price of a reservation on Airbnb is based on the nightly rate (based price per night), which is sole set by the host, plus other fees such as service fees, cleaning fee, etc. 

**Datasets**

The data used in this project is generated from “Inside Airbnb”, which uses data sourced from publicly available information from the Airbnb site. http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. The original raw datasets used in this project all stored in the data folder.


**Project purpose**

It is important for hosts to understand Airbnb pricing and value the place correctly. This project aims to help hosts to determine a proper nightly rate based on the pricing model built from a range of relative factors in the New York Area.

**Python Libraries**
Data cleanning: pandas, numpy
Data Exploratory analysis: matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, geopandas, nltk.sentiment.vader, SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, SelectKBest, WordCloud
Data Model: sklearn.model_selection(train_test_split),sklearn.feature_selection, pandas, sklearn.ensemble(RandomForestRegressor),sklearn.metrics(R^2), matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, numpy

**data preprocessing**

The data preprocessing folder contains all the data processing codes. Initial clean, natural language processing, detect and remove outliers with Z score, feature selection. 

**Visualization**

The Visualization folder contains visual plots. 
As we can see from the plots, Mahanttan is the most expensive area and also has highest numbers of listings.
Entire home/apt consititude about 75-80% of listings type.
Wordcloud plots give some key words regarding description, house rules that host can pay attention to while renting the place.

**Model**

The Model folder contains the final codes that contribute to price prediction for Airbnb owner, as well as the cleaned dataset to run with it.
After running different algorithms including Linear Regression, K Means, Decision Tree, Multiple Regression, we finalize choosing Random Forest Model with highest accuracy ( abt 85%) as our price model. 

**Web develop**

With the support of Prof, our group run inial Web develop as link http://aec4.com/cis9650/airbnb.py 
Hosts can use the link and input their available data. Output will be suggested price housing.
The details code are inside the Web develop folder.
