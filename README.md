# **Airbnb Price Prediction - CIS 9650**

**Problem**

Airbnb is one of the largest online marketplaces for arranging or offering apartments, homestays and lodging. The number of bookings and listings are growing fast, there are over 6 million listings worldwide in 2019. New York is listed as one of the top 10 popular cities for booking experiences in the world.
The total price of a reservation on Airbnb is based on the nightly rate (based price per night), which is sole set by the host, plus other fees such as service fees, cleaning fee, etc. 

**Datasets**

The data used in this project is generated from “Inside Airbnb”, which uses data sourced from publicly available information from the Airbnb site. http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html.

**Project purpose**

It is important for hosts to understand Airbnb pricing and value the place correctly. This project aims to help hosts to determine a proper nightly rate based on the pricing model built from a range of relative factors in the New York Area.
